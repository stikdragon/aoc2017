# Advent of Code
Advent of Code, this is called aoc2017 but it's actually for all years... oops :)

Most of these have been written with an emphasis on getting them done fast, so 
error checking is fairly rudimentary and input checking/cleaning is basically non-
existent.  Runtime performance hasn't been much of a consideration, although if 
any of my specific puzzle inputs are causing it to go slow then i'll probably have
put a bit more thought into it, but it's possible another player's input strings
might cause other puzzles to break/go slow.
